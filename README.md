ðŸŒŸ Dynamic UI Flutter App
This is a dynamic UI-based Flutter app that loads its design and content from a remote JSON file named dynamic.json. Inspired by apps like Blinkit and Zepto, this app allows you to update its layout and content dynamically by modifying the JSON file, without requiring an app rebuild or update.
